## Loader Components

These components are responsible for loading new data into the view.  

The pager component is the primary component used for advancing through a list of results.  Pager also initializes the page data on load.

The sortOptions component is used in collection views to sort by field, toggle sort order, and filter by terms (or year).

The discovery filter container and discovery filter components are used on discovery pages.  (The discoveryFilter component is also used in the advanced search view).
